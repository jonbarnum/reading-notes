# What Google Learned From ITs Quest to Build the Perfect Team

This is actually a very interesting article. Through the research done by Rozovsky and her google colleagues is something that hits close to home. In the intuition groups that we created they tried to find patterns for how and why teams succeed or did not succeed. They were having a really hard time finding a solution and trends that helped them to know what helps the team succeed. One thing that did come about is allowing people to feel they are in a safe spot to share ideas without the fear of being ridiculed or put down. This had to have some very clear standards when the group started but when the process and standards were followed people felt safe and were able to work well together. Another thing is that team members need to be sensitive to other team members.
