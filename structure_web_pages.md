# Structure web page with html

# Wireframing 

This is the process of deciding on how you want your html page to look. Through time and experience one will be able to envision what they want their webpage to look like before one starts adding information to it. To get inspiration one can look at different web pages or apps to come up with inspiration. Once one has an idea of what they want, they should draw it out on a piece of paper or on a whiteboard. This will give a visual representation for it. Then if one feels comfortable with their idea, a coder can start coding the web page. If one would like to use an electronic form rather than paper and pencil, there are a few tools that can be used online. These are UXPin, Invision, or wireframe.cc to name a few. By doing this one will start to get an envision on what they want to code. Once a coder has a vision then it will give the coder confidence to create a beautiful webpage. 

# Html

Is a markup language for websites. It will help the coder decide how the web page should look. There are many things one can do with a web page. Each web page is composed of elements and each element had tags at the beginning and of the element such as <>words<>. Inside of the angle brackets a coder will put something inside of it so it can be identified.

Setting up the basic web page.

Opening tag with exclamation and DOCTYPE html.

Opening/closing tag with html.

Opening/closing tag with head.

Then opening tag with meta charset=utf-8.

Then opening/closing tag with a title of work.


To add a header, inside the tag, place an h1 to h4. H1 will give the largest header.
To add a paragraph, place a p inside the tag.
For unordered list ul
For ordered list ol
For links place an a inside the tag. On the beginning tag also place a hfre that is = to the address link which is wrapped in quotations.

Each code will have meaning, which is aka semantics. Everything that is written in code will have meaning. Each code that is placed will make the web page look different depending on what is written. Some semantics areas would be headers, footers, articles and section to name a few.
