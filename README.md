# Introduction
Hello, My name is Jon Barnum. I am a native from Utah where I have been living here on and off for most of my life. I was in the Army as a military police and decided being a police officer was not for me. I then went on to become a registered nurse where I worked in the emergency department. Though I did enjoy some of the work it became apparent to me that I was destined to do something more fulfilling in my life. I have a beautiful wife and 4 awesome kids that keep me very busy.

## Growth Mindset 
Growth mindset to me means taking challenges and learning from them. With learning something new it is easy to want to give up because it is new or hard to understand. Of course it will be difficult because this is new and I have no experience with computer coding. The most important aspect of this is to know this is a challenge and **this will take time to learn**. **Donâ€™t give up and keep moving forward**. With time, patience and perseverance, I will start to learn computing coding.

### How to keep in the _Growth Mindset_!
1. Never Compare myself to anyone else.
2. Know it will take time.
3. Breath and say it will take time to learn. 
4. Give myself credit for what I do know.
5. Hit the believe button.


#### This is my motto
P.T Barnum once said > Comfort is the enemy to progress
