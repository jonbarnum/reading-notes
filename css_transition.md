# CSS Transform

CSS transforms come into two different properties, two dimension and three dimensional. The only problem is that some browsers do not support transform. 2d transform is used by ```transform: rotate(40deg)``` This will rotate an object by 40 degrees. You can also use ```transform: scale(.65)```. A programmer can also use scaleX, scaleY if they want to scale just the x axis or the y axis. ```transform: schew(10deg)``` will distort the image by a certain degree. Also, a programmer can isolate the x or y axis.  Other options are perspective. For 3d items use the ```scaleZ(.50)`` as an example. The sacceZ uses the z axis.

## Transitions

For transitions the best way to do it is use the 4 different transitions properties such as transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and the transition-delay. For transition time use .3s or 1s as an example to indicate time is seconds for the transition. The same goes for transition-delay. 

So other transitions are fade in, change color, grow and shrink, rotate elements, square to circle, 3d shadow, swing, inset border, for a great resource and example got the the following [8 Simple css3 transitions that will wow your users](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users/)
