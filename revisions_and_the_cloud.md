## Git 

Git takes snapshots of the code that is being imputed. Head which means where you are at right now. When you commit you can also add messages with the commits. This will allow you to know what you did and why you did it. This is best practice, however they are public. 

If not already done so a coder can go on the git website and download the necessary files for the computer. Once the files have been downloaded then on the command line of the terminal one can type git config --list which will allow the user to see the settings.If one needs help then one could type hit help command which should pull a help menu.

## GitHub

Github is a way for the coders to share their code. When you place your code in Github it will store it online so you can have it backed up. You can also collaborate with others and their code.

## Repositories

Repository is a collection of files. Usually for one repository will be one project. You can find them online or on the computer. To work on your repositories through VS code one can bring up their files from Github to the terminal and then vs code. However, one needs to clone their key from the repository from github and type in git clone and then the link on the terminal line. This needs to be done in the terminal file that you have chosen. From there it should bring in your files from Github. One would be able to access the files from the terminal and start coding with vs code. 

To do so, coders will use an acronym to help them remember what needs to be done once they have made changes from vs code and want to push the code back to Github.

## ACP acronym 

ACP- add, commit, and push

Github => repo => clone => ACP => git add ‘filename’, git commit _m “message”, git push origin main
Add- telling the computer you have changes that need to be made
Commit- telling the computer you are ready to to make those changes
Push- push the changes 

If you have multiple files that you have changed throughout the coding process then one can use the git add (.) which will add all the different files you have worked on.
### Other information

There are other functions that you can use from the terminal. One would be able to see remote repositories by typing git remote. One would also be able to fetch data that needs to be pulled down from Github by typing git fetch and then the remote name. Push information back to GitHub git push. When collaborating with others one will be able to create branches so others can work on the project. In turn there are many options you can do with others for the branches such as creating new ones, merging, renaming, deleting, and previewing.
