# JS Debugging

There are tools built into the computer that will help a programmer debug. Also, by knowing the basics of programming and the language being used then the programmer should have some knowledge as well which will help. 

One of the things the programmer needs to know is order of operation. By misplacing code in the wrong or can throw bugs into the code. So, make sure code is being put in order of operation. The scope of the code will help as well. The programmer needs to know if their code is global scope or local. 

When writing code code will go through two different phases which are to prepare and execute and each time a code goes through a new piece of code it will prepare and then execute. While the code is preparing and trying to execute it may throw an error in the console. The programmer will need to understand what the console is trying to say. It will give a small definition on the error and where the error is happening.

Some things to look out for are spelling errors, missing an starting or ending quotation, comma errors and spaces in places where there should not be. These small things are very important and by using the console, it could help identify some of these errors. Go back over the work and read everything very carefully.

On the inspector of chrome, a programmer can right click on a webpage and bring up the inspect tool that will be very valuable to use in debugging. A programmer can add breakpoint to a code
