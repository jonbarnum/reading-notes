# HTML Tables

When creating a webpage, a programmer can make a table within the site. This can be done by using ```<table></table>```. Use ```<tr></tr>``` for the table row and ```<td></td>``` for the table data, ```<th></th>``` for a table heading. If one needs to span the column then use ```<colspan=”2”>``` with the td element. The two that are passed through indicate that you want the column to span 2 cells. Spanning rows is very similar but uses ```<rowspan=”2”>```. If the table is going to be a long table then use ```<thead></thead>``` which is table head, ```<tbody></tbody>``` table body and ```<tfoot></tfoot>``` table foot.
