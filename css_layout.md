# CSS Layout

In CSS there are elements that are block level such as ```<h1>,<p>, <li>``` while others are inline elements such as ```<img>, <b>``` . If a block element sits within another block level then the outer container is called the parent and the one sitting in it is the child.

There are different ways to position elements. These include: normal flow, relative position, absolute position, fixed position and floating.

Also when a web developer is creating CSS for a webpage , they need to be mindful of the screen size and how many pixels each screen can have. Depending on the screen size will distort the webpage. To combat this problem, you can have a fixed layout or liquid layouts that helps adjust the screen according to the screen size. Another great idea when creating CSS for a web page is going on the world wide web and googling possible layouts.
