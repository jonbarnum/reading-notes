# JS Loops

Loops are a very quick and efficient way for code to be repeated multiple times without the need to retype the same code out over and over.

There are many different kinds of loops such as for statements, while statements, break statements, for in statements and labeled statements to name a few.

# Statements

**For statements** code will continue running until it finds something in the code that is false.

**Do...while** is code that will do the same thing and run until it evaluates for something that is false.

**While statements** will run until it screens for something that is true.

**Labeled statements** will allow code to reference another identifier that has been used elsewhere in the code.

If a code will want to end a loop then they can use the **break statement**.

If a coder will want to start the loop again then can use the **continued statement**.
