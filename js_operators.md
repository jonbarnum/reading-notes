# JS Operators

An operator is something that performs something that can get a product from the operation. JS has many different operators.

To name a few:

Assignments operator
Arithmetic 
String
Logical
Comma
Relational

Each assignment operator in JS has a specific operation that it does to help to get an end result.

For the unary, binary and ternary operators each needs a certain number of operands to perform. Unary needs 1, binary needs 2 and ternary needs 3.

For an assignment operator, it takes an equal sign and assigns the value of the on the left to the right.

Return operator there will be a return value.

Destructuring is when there are multiple expressions that could be combined.

Comparison is when you are taking different values and comparing them.

There are arithmetic operators that perform calculations such as adding, substrating, multiplying and dividing.

The bitwise operator turns information into 32 bits.

# Control Flow

Control flow is how the computer is going to execute the written code. It will be read from top to bottom thus the first line will be read and the last line will be read last.

# Functions

Take a block of code that you want to do something, you now have a function. That function will execute once it is called on.

The syntax for a function is,  Function then a name for the function then () {}. The code written inside {} is what you want to be executed. Inside the parentheses will be the parameters. If the code is written with a return statement then the code will stop executing once it gets to the return statement and returns a value.
