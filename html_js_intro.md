# HTML Basics

The structure of a web page is html.  To start a basic web page there are a few things one will need to know to create a web page.

- Web pages are created by having tags suchs as ``` <p></p> ``` and in between the tags there is written text, which will show up on the web page. The beginning tag plus written text between the tags and the closing tags are known collectively as an element. Inside of a tag there could be other code that gives more information about the text which are called attributes.

-Each web page will have a body, head, title that will look something like this.

~~~
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
	<head>
	</head>

		<body>
		  <header>
          </header>
          <footer>
          </footer>
		</body
    </html>
~~~


While working on the web page a coder may want to leave a comment for self or someone else who may look at the code. To write a comment it will look like this

```  <!-- comment goes here -->  ```

- Id attributes are specific to that element and only that element which goes inside a tag. For example ``` <p id=”main paragraph”>This is the main paragraph</p> ```

- Class attributes are similar to id attributes but they are grouping other elements under the same name. For example 

```
 <h1 class=”headings”>Main heading</h1>
<h2 class=”headings”>second heading</h2>

```

There are other element tags that help separate the web page,  paragraph, and text. Here are a few examples

```
<div></div>
<span></span>
<iframe></iframe>
<nav></nav>
<header></header>
<footer></footer>

```

A very critical step is trying to figure out how you want your web page to look like. There are many different ways this can be accomplished. There are onlines tools that allow you to draw out what the web page should look like. Another option is using pen or paper. One could use a marker board as well. Once you have an outline on what the web page is supposed to look like then start coding!!!


# JavaScript

JavaScript is written code that instructs the web browser to perform certain tasks. In essence it takes your web page and makes it more interactive. Though the code needs to be written in a way that allows the web browser to interpret and execute the code. Just like an html code, a web programmer needs to plan out the overall pictures on what needs to be done. Then, a plan for each individual step needs to be planned out as well. This can be done by defining a goal, sketching it out, then code it out. The programmer will use objects and methods to allow the computer to create the image the programmer has envisioned.
