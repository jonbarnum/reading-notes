# Terminal
Many people when using a computer click on a file and then click on the file they will want. This will open the file and a user will be able to see what is inside that file. This is known as graphical user interface (GUI). However, those same files can be accessed through terminal which can be found on mac operating systems or command line for windows operating system. Within the terminal there will be a shell and this shell lets the terminal know how to work once a command is placed. Within the terminal there are many shells but the most common shell is bash.

# Navigation within Terminal
-**pwd** (print working directory) This will show the user where the user’s present directory is at.
-**ls** will show what is currently in that directory
Once you know what content is in the directory you can find paths to those areas through absolute or relative paths.
-**Absolute path** with have / in front of the file name. This tells the user the specified path based off of the root directory.
-**Relative path**- will show the location of the file based on where the user is at in the directory.
-**cd** will change the directory.

When using a terminal it is case sensitive as well as one needs to be careful with spacing. When there is a space between words, the terminal will only look for the first word. If one is searching for two words then they can add quotations around the words and terminal will search for the words. Another way to search for both words is putting a backslash between the words. This will look for both words as well.
