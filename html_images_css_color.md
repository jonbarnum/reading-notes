# HTML Images

Websites can contain images and those images can be coded onto your website through two different ways. One way is grabbing the picture from another source and the other option is storing images on the programmer computer and retrieving them from the computer. Either is perfectly fine to use. When adding images to the website the programmer will need to use a couple of different things. 

```<img src=”” alt=” title=”/>```

src- where the picture is located at. This can be either another place on the internet or computer
alt- text description of the photo for those who can’t see
Title- title of picture

The width and height of the picture can be changed as well and this can be done through html or css. One of the most important issues with web development is knowing where to place the image on the webpage. This is something that comes with time. Also, knowing how to save the picture on the computer. If the picture has a lot of vibrant colors then the picture should be saved as a jpeg. Pictures with few colors should be saved as a gif or png. The web developer may need to photoshop some of the pictures to make them portrait or landscape and for resizing. There are a lot of different options on the web and other programs that can be used for these tasks. New to html 5 is a figures element that looks like this ```<figure></figure>```. The imaged tag can go between the figure element and also have a caption that looks like this: ```<figcaption></figcaption>```.

# CSS Color

Through CSS a programmer can give the webpage lots of color. There are many ways to call for the different colors which are through RGB values, Hex codes, color names, hue, saturation and brightness, contrast, and opacity. A quick google search of any of these will give examples, color wheels and other useful information. With CSS there is also HSL which allows for the hue, saturation and lightness. Or there is even another which is HSLA with hue, saturation, lightness and alpha.

- Hue is the color wheel which goes from 0 to 360.
- Saturation is how much gray is let in and is represented by 0 to 100%.
- Lightness is the amount of white that is allowed in also represented by 0 to 100%.
- alpha is how transparent the color is. 0 - 1 or by a percentage.

# CSS Text

Text is very important to the website as well. There are many different things that one can do to their text on the webpage. It is important to set up some font families that are used throughout the different web browsers such as google, safari, and internet explorer to name a few. Some of the names of a few typefaces are serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and fantasy. Also with fonts you can change the weight, style and stretch. Weight can be light, medium, bold, black. Style can be normal, italic or oblique. Stretch can be condensed, regular, extended.

- Text-transform can change uppercase, lowercase and capitalize.
- Text-decoration can have none, underline, overline, line-though, blink.
- Text-align can move the text left, right, center, justify

 A web developer can put in line-height, letter-spacing, word-spacing, vertical-align, text-indent, text-shadow, and there are three suda classes  to change the appearance of an element. Those are :hover, :active, :focus.
