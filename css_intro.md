# CSS

CSS helps the web page with style. This could include color, background images, font style and much more. It stands for cascading style sheet (CSS). When a coder is using CSS, one must select a selector from the html document such as p or h2. To find these one will need to look inside the html tags. Start off by declaring the selected then use curly braces {}. Inside the curly braces add the property such as color followed by : and the value such as blue. One thing that will be useful as one is creating style for a web page is to find a website that allows one to see what is compatible with other web browsers.

Example: 
 ```css
    p {
	    Color: blue;	
    }
```


# Adding CSS

There are many different ways to add CSS to a web page.
1- External CSS which means a coder has created an external document that is linked to an html document. The external document must be saved with a .css.
2- Internal CSS which means placing CSS directing onto the html within the style element.
3- Inline CSS which means placing CSS within a tag.

# Cascading

When the browser is trying to figure out which order to put CSS in it will place it from highest priority to lowest priority such as Inline, external and internal, then to browser default.

# Adding Color

When adding color there are a couple of different options to choose from. One is typing the color in such as red. Another option is using the hex color code system which starts with a pound symbol followed by 6 digit code that includes numbers and letters. Lastly there is the RGB color system as well. Since there are so many different combinations on both the hex and RGB one can simply go to google, type in hex color and choose a color from the color picker and google will show that number. Simply place the number into your CSS code
