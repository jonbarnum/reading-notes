# CSS Images

Images can be controlled in a CSS file. A programmer can adjust the height and width by calling the image and then put height with a px amount or percentage. The same goes for the width. If a programmer wants pictures to have words next to them, then they will need to do a float left or a float right depending on where they want the picture. Also an image can be centered by doing a display: block, then having no margin for the top and the bottom with auto margin on the left and right. If a background image is to be used then do a background-image: then the url. If you want the image to repeat then after the background image do background-repeat: repeat. Other options are repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat, fixed, or scroll. The background image can be placed in other places on the web page as well. background-position : then left top, left center, left bottom, center top, center center, center bottom, right top, right center, right bottom. The background image can have its contrast changed as well.
