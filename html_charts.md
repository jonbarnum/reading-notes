# HTML Charts

Along with all of the other html we are learning about there is even more that we can learn about, which is a programmer can program charts into the web page. First the web programmer will need to grab some downloads from chart.js. Then add the scr within the script tag. When creating a line chart, start with ```<canvas></canvas>```. Within the beginning tag you can add attributes just as id, width and height. Then within the javascript file one will need to set a variable and then get element by id. Example let homeBuyers = document.getElementById(‘whatever the id name is’).getContext(‘2d’); new Chart(what the variable is called).Line(name of chart). A pie chart is going to be very similar in how a programmer will create a chart. The difference is when you put new Chart(name of variable).Pie(pieData, pieOptions);. Then in javascript create and object with the pie data. There will be a value key pair. One will be value and how much of the pie it takes up and then color and color value. The bar chart is very similar as well. For reference go to this website. https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/

Also using the canvas tag, programmers can draw shapes. For a great reference into drawing shapes go to the following link. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes
