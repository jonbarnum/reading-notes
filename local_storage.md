Browsers can store up user data on their web pages. When HTML 5 came along the web storage split on how they store data. Some places call it local storage or DOM storage . It allows web pages to store key value pairs locally and the personâ€™s computer who is using that website. The data can be any type of data that is supported by javascript. There are ways to access the information and it needs to be called on, such as getItem(). There are other options as well such as setItem(), removeItem() and clear(). The local storage has a limit of 5 megabytes.
